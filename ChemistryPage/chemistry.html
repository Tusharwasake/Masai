        <h1>Chemistry Assignment</h1>
        <p>Chemistry is the branch of science that deals with the properties, composition, and behavior of matter. It is a fascinating field that explores the building blocks of the universe.</p>
        <h1>Chemical Elements</h1>
        <p>The <a href="https://www.ptable.com" target="_blank" style="background-color: yellow; text-decoration: none;">periodic table</a> 
             is a tabular arrangement of chemical elements. Each element is represented by its chemical symbol, such as Fe for iron, H for hydrogen, and O for oxygen. Elements are classified into groups and periods based on their properties.</p>
        <h2>Chemical Equations</h2>
        
        <p>2H<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>2</sub>  &rarr; 2H<sub>2</sub>O</p>
        
        <p>This equation represents the reaction between hydrogen gas (H<sub>2</sub>)  and oxygen gas (O<sub>2</sub>)
            to form water (H<sub>2</sub>O).
        </p>
        
        <h3>Important Concepts</h3>
        <p><dfn>Stoichiometry</dfn> is the calculation of reactants and products in chemical reactions. It involves balancing chemical equations to ensure mass and charge are conserved.</p>
        <p><sub>Subscripts</sub> indicate the number of atoms of each element in a molecule, while <sup>superscripts</sup> represent charges or the number of atoms in an ion.
        </p>
        
        <h4>Conclusion</h4>
        
        <p>Chemistry plays a crucial role in understanding the world around us. From the composition of the air we breathe to the reactions that power our bodies, chemistry influences every aspect of our lives.</p>
